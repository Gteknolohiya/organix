## Why OrganiX
OrganiX is a computer file organizer that uses voice commands to simplify the file organization process for computer users. With increasingly busy schedules and growing amounts of data, it can be difficult to keep track of and manage all the files on our devices. OrganiX aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution that simplifies the file organization process and helps users maintain a clutter-free digital workspace.

## How it Contributes to SDG

OrganiX contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting both quality education (SDG 4) and responsible consumption and production patterns (SDG 12).

</p>

OrganiX supports quality education by helping students and educators maintain a well-organized digital workspace, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency in their studies or teaching. By providing an easy-to-use tool for managing files and resources, OrganiX allows users to focus on learning and sharing knowledge, ultimately contributing to the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.

Additionally, By helping users better organize and manage their digital files, OrganiX encourages more efficient use of resources, reduces electronic waste, and minimizes the need for additional storage hardware. This, in turn, contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious digital ecosystem.

## Features
OrganiX offers a range of powerful voice-activated features designed to enhance file organization and management:

1. __Advance File Organizer__:open_file_folder: : Users can verbally instruct OrganiX to automatically organize files based on their type into predefined or customizable folders, making it easy for them to locate and manage their documents, images, videos, and other file types.

2. __Temporary File Deleter__:wastebasket: : Users can include a ".temp" keyword in files meant for one-time use (e.g., images downloaded for a single project), and instruct OrganiX to swiftly delete all such temporary files with a single voice command. This frees up storage space and enhances system performance by eliminating cache files, logs, and other short-term data.

3. __Auto Rename__:memo: : Automatically rename multiple files in a folder using a pre-defined naming convention, saving time and effort in manual file renaming.
  
4. __Change Folder Path__:arrows_counterclockwise: : Enables users to modify the folder path where operations will be conducted. With a simple voice command, users can easily dictate a new working directory for the OrganiX operations, providing increased flexibility and control over file organization tasks.
