## Why OrganiX
We developed OrganiX because we understand the challenges that many students and laptop users face when it comes to organizing their digital files. With increasingly busy schedules and growing amounts of data, it can be difficult to keep track of and manage all the files on our laptops. OrganiX aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution that simplifies the file organization process and helps users maintain a clutter-free digital workspace.

## How it Contributes to SDG

OrganiX contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting both responsible consumption and production patterns (SDG 12) and quality education (SDG 4).

</p>

OrganiX supports quality education by helping students and educators maintain a well-organized digital workspace, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency in their studies or teaching. By providing an easy-to-use tool for managing files and resources, OrganiX allows users to focus on learning and sharing knowledge, ultimately contributing to the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.

Additionally, By helping users better organize and manage their digital files, OrganiX encourages more efficient use of resources, reduces electronic waste, and minimizes the need for additional storage hardware. This, in turn, contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious digital ecosystem.

4. __Automatic Workspace Sanitizer__: Detects and addresses clutter, duplicates, and misplaced files, helping users maintain a clean and organized workspace with minimal manual intervention.
